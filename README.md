# DentistTool

## Description

A small tool I'm developing for my parents to help them during their daily routine in their dental clinic. 

My parents needed a small tool that measures the time while the patient is doing a mouth wash with hydrogen peroxide before his/her treatment begings (this an extra security procedure because of COVID-19). They also have to say the same sentence over and over again after the predefined time of the mouth wash has elapsed. That's why we did a recording of this sentence and let my application play it after the timer has finished.

With the tool, my parents can now concentrate on other things that are more important during treatment preparation instead of measuring the time themselves and think about that sentence they would have to say at the end of the mouth wash. 

I believe that this small but helpful tool would be a great opportunity to develop using Angular, because I can use and practice a lof of the Angular design principles and functionalities, like component lifecycle, communication between components, Angular Material Design, angular routing and so on. Thus, this projects also serves as a training project for myself. 

### Functions

This tool can do the following: 

- use as stoppwatch (done)
- use as timer (done)
- configure timer (done)
- play soundsamples at the end of timer (done)
- choose between different voices for the end of timer soundsamples

### ToDo

- use more Observables for cleaner code (WIP)
- play music while timer is running (optional)

### More information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.

The rest of this readme contains (slightly customized) standard content of a project that was generated using the Angular CLI. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component \components\[component-name]` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
