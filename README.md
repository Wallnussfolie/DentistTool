# DentistTool

## Description

A small tool I'm developing for my parents to help them during their daily routine in their dental clinic. 

This project also serves as a training project for myself to practice Angular. 

### Functions

This tool can do the following: 

- use as stoppwatch (done)
- use as timer (done)
- configure timer (done)
- play soundsamples at the end of timer (done)
- use more Observables for cleaner code (WIP)

### More information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.

The rest of this readme contains (slightly customized) standard content of a project that was generated using the Angular CLI. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component \components\[component-name]` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
